Union bug that is quite annoying.
https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/issues/873

Having to deal with memory allocation is really annoying when dealing with data structures like trees, maps, lists and strings.

Writing the error systems is genuinely making me want to kms... I never realised how annoying string and datastructure manupulation
was without managed memory

Some things are missing from the standard library

code can get very verbose look at the interpreter for an example

It is very clearly not suitable at all for writing programming languages. Honestly even raw C is probably better at it.
It's pretty clear the intended usecase was game development of something similar.
