This is not meant to a properly written review, if you want a proper opinion read the code.

## Negatives

- There  is a union bug that is quite annoying (closed though so maybe it is intended). <https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/issues/873>
- Having to deal with memory allocation is really annoying when dealing with data structures like trees, maps, lists and strings.
- Some things are missing from the standard library. For example it would be nice to have a remove_elem function.
- Code can get very verbose look at the interpreter for an example.
- It's clearly not suitable at all for writing programming languages. Honestly even C is probably better at it.
- Generics are a bit confusing.

## Positives

- Seems pretty good for game dev.
- Lots of nice included libraries like raylib.
- Very easy to learn/read. If you know C it should take you like 40 minutes to start writing.
